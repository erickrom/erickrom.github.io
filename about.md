Hi, this is my personal blog!

I don't expect many people to visit this site.  It's mostly intended as a 'note to self' for me to add my thoughts on things I might want to remember down the line or for later use.

I'll mostly be blogging about stuff I find useful at work or on any project I'm working on, mostly Ruby on Rails and Web Stuff.

If you stumble across this blog and want to say hi, hit me up!

### Want to know more about me?

I'm a Software and Web Developer, currently working at HP.  I attended [Los Angeles City College](https://www.lacitycollege.edu/) and then transferred to [UCLA](http://engineering.ucla.edu/) where I got a degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2009.

I worked as a summer intern for HP for 4 summers, mostly in the Roseville area, and started working full time at HP in Vancouver, WA since February of 2010.

I've been working on Web Development since 2010, and on Ruby on Rails since 2013.

I currently reside in Vancouver WA, with my beautiful wife, a baby boy born in April 2017, and our dog Fiona.
